I made this like a year ago, i don't remember any of it. Just thought of putting it out here. So cheers if you understand any of it.

It will be a common system in use where a client can speak with the server
associated in a same network area (LAN). To put together such vast lines of
communication required we need basic socket connections to interface through
a network. Socket programming utilizes the client attachment and server
attachment techniques to interface the local host to the named host and port.
The communication between them is finished utilizing client server model. A few
client machines are associated with their server ports and communication is
built up.

In such a scenario, RSA and DES encryption can be put to use to create
a secure environment for communication ensuring confidentiality.
